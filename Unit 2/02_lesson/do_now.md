# Do Now 2.02

## Part 1

Open up the console. Type each line of the following code into the interactive editor:

```python
 5 < 3
 5 > 3
 type(5 < 3)
 type(5 > 3)
 my_fav_animal = "cats"
 user_fav_animal = input("What is your favorite animal? ")
 my_fav_animal == user_fav_animal
 ```

### Discuss 

1. What does `5 < 3` evaluate to?  
2. What is the type of `5 < 3`? What does that stand for?
3. What is the difference between `==` and `=` ?
4. What data type do you think `my_fav_animal == user_fav_animal` is?

## Part 2

Open up the console. Type the following code into the interactive editor.

```python
 months_with_driving_permit = 6
 age = 16
 can_get_license = months_with_driving_permit >= 6 and age >= 16
 print(can_get_license)
```

### In your notebook, add this to your notes:

1. What does `and` do here? What type do you think `can_get_license` is?
2. Update the code to fit the new driving law:
   If you are over the age of 18 you don't need to have a permit.

## Part 3

Open up the console. Type the following code into the interactive editor.

```python
animal = 'mouse'
animal == 'cat' or 'dog'
animal == 'cat' or animal == 'dog'
```

### In your notebook, add answers to the following:

1. What does = and == do here?
2. What is the difference between the two `or` statements?
