# 2.02 Boolean Expressions

## Guided Notes
## Part 1

Open up the console. Type each line of the following code into the interactive editor:

```python
 5 < 3
 5 > 3
 type(5 < 3)
 type(5 > 3)
 my_fav_animal = "cats"
 user_fav_animal = input("What is your favorite animal? ")
 my_fav_animal == user_fav_animal
```

### Answer as a comment 

1. What does `5 < 3` evaluate to?  
2. What is the type of `5 < 3`? What does that stand for?
3. What is the difference between `==` and `=` ?
4. What data type do you think `my_fav_animal == user_fav_animal` is?

## Part 2

Open up the console. Type the following code into the interactive editor.

```python
 months_with_driving_permit = 6
 age = 16
 can_get_license = months_with_driving_permit >= 6 and age >= 16
 print(can_get_license)
```

### Answer as a comment:

1. What does `and` do here? What type do you think `can_get_license` is?
2. Update the code to fit the new driving law:
   If you are over the age of 18 you don't need to have a permit.

## Part 3

Open up the console. Type the following code into the interactive editor.

```python
animal = 'mouse'
animal == 'cat' or 'dog'
animal == 'cat' or animal == 'dog'
```

### In your notebook, add answers to the following:

1. What does = and == do here?
2. What is the difference between the two `or` statements?

# Lab 2.02 - Can I or Can't I?

## Make a prediction

Predict if each of the following examples will produce a `True` or `False` output. Record your answers as a comment

### Example 1

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    a > 75 and b == "science"
```

### Example 2

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    a > 75 and b != "science"
```

### Example 3

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    a > 75 or b != "science"
```

### Example 4

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    c = True
    not c and a > 75 and b == "science"
```
## Practice

### Complete the following coding challenge

1. Create a "Can I be President?" program, which determines if the user meets the minimum requirements for becoming the President of the United States. Have the user input the information needed.

    **The minimum requirements to be president of the United States are:**

    * Older than 35
    * Resident of US for 14 Years
    * Natural born citizen
    
    Print True if the person could be president and False if they can't be president.

2. Create a "Can I ride the roller coaster?" program. It will check to see if the user meets the minimum requirements to ride the roller coaster. Have the user input the information needed.

    **Requirements to ride the roller coaster:**
    * Height over 50 inches â€“ loophole allows any height if older than 18
    * Each ride costs 4 quarters.
    * There is a frequent rider pass, which makes the rides only cost 2 quarters.

    Print True if the user can ride the roller coaster, and False if not.

## OPTIONAL: Bonus

### Are the following expressions equivalent? Research DeMorgan's Laws and write why you think they are the same or why they are not the same

`not(x or y) == not x and not y`

`not(x and y) == not x or not y`
