##  Project overview

Design a __Mad Lib__ using Python Programming Language

* What is a *Mad Lib*?
* Prompts MUST ask for the correct noun-verb combinations.
* Look at the grading rubric continuously throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements.

### Chunk the Problem
* Identify the sub problems of MadLibs.
  * What is the expected output of your program?
  * What is the minimum that needs to be working in order for you to "copy and paste" the rest?
  * What parts do you need to do in sequence?
* Have students list what variables, inputs, and print statements they will need.

### Project work

* This project is a summative assessment for the unit. By the end, you will have demonstrated mastery of the unit objectives.
* Average worktime - 1 hour
* Assess progress using peer reviews, ask your classmates to try it out!
  *  3 before me ;)
* You are able to ask questions in class throughout the project, but try to ask each other for help as well! I don't expect you to remember absolutely everything.
* Comment everything

## Turn In:
* Your complete, working *Mad Libs* program to this assignment.
  * When I press `Run`, I should be able to interact with your program
* Mark as Done on [Google Classroom](http://classroom.google.com)
