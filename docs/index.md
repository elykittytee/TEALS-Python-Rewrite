# Welcome to Intro to CS

This is an appreciative teacher's modified rewrite of a curriculum originally developed by Microsoft TEALS. The original implementation was for the second semester of a year-long course, Repl.it Classroom still existed, and online learning wasn't as robust as it is currently.

Fast forward to this day: *Repl.it* is now *Replit*, Repl.it Classroom has now been integrated into Replit Teams, and there are many more features that Replit has developed in order to include as many coders online as much as possible.
