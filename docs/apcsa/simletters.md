# Similar Letters

## Objectives
* obj1
* obj2

## Assignment Restrictions:
Using the main method, print letters to 3 people of your choice.

These letters will be very similar to each other, with 1 paragraph in common with all letters.
Create 3 methods as your main program should only have three method calls.

## Helpful Hints:
Try to isolate repeated tasks into methods. Include comments in with your code so others can easily understand what your code is supposed to do.
