# 2.04 Lists - Food Quiz (Optional)

Create a food quiz using lists and indexes.

1. Create a list of 6 different foods.
2. Ask the user 8 general questions to find out what their favorite food is from the list.
3. Update a score list for each food.
4. Print out the user's favorite food based on the score list. (see _Research_)

## Research
### How do you find the largest number? 
Research how it's done and incorporate. I will only help you with the process of _how_ this is done. It is up to you to implement it in Python.

## OPTIONAL: Bonus Behavior

* Use the score list to print out the user's second favorite food as well as the favorite.
* Tied scores can be handled in any reasonable way -- e.g., print the tied-score food item earliest on the list as the "favorite", and the next item as the "second favorite".
* Alternatively, check for the existence of a tie, and acknowledge that situation when it happens by printing a separate message. 
* Hint: as with the favorite score, using syntax we've learned so far, we can only find this value if we know the length of our food list, using a series of if...elif statements. Alternate methods that use much less code can be found with an Internet search. Some of these methods will be covered in later units.

## Student Code - `main.py`
```python

### START ###
food = ['donuts', 'pancakes', 'bacon', 'waffles', 'eggs', 'bagels']
score = [0,0,0,0,0,0]

print('Please answer each question with "y" for "yes" and "n" for "no".')
user_input = input('Do you like food made with holes? ')
if user_input == 'y' or user_input == 'Y':
  score[0] = score[0] + 1
  score[5] = score[5] + 1

## Add remaining questions below this line, and adjust scores similar to the above. ##
