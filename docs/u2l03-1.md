# 2.03 - Conditionals - Part 1

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: `if, else, elif, conditionals, flow of control`
* Create chaining if statements
* Understand how conditional statements alter the flow of control of a program

## Activity

In the IDE, create a schedule program. Given the hour of the day, print out where you should be. If you're not doing anything else you should be "sleeping".

### Example Output
```python
Hour? 5am
sleeping...zZz
Hour? 6am
wake up!
Hour? 7am
go to school
Hour? 8am
Intro to CS

```
### Discussion
Underneath your program, answer the following reflection questions as comments:

1. How did you accomplish this?
2. Did you feel like something was missing in your program?  
3. What if you wanted to add in a weekly functionality? For instance, maybe on Tuesday at 4pm you are at soccer practice, but on Thursday at 4pm you are at math club!
4. How would you implement this in your program?

## Student Code - `main.py`
```python
