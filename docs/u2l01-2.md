# 2.01 Practice

### Practice Writing Programs
Using Python, answer the 4 prompts to practice casting and input functions

---
#### Expected Behavior

The program will introduce the user to the operation and expected answer.

Example:
```
Add two numbers together and see the results.
```
The user will be prompted to enter a number or two

Example:
```
Add two numbers together and see the results.

Give me a number to add: 10
Give me another number to add: 15
```

The program will then print the result.

Example:
```
Add two numbers together and see the results.

Give me a number to add: 10
Give me another number to add: 15

Result: 25
```
**NOTE: the numbers 10 and 15 are _user inputs_**

---
### Concepts
* The default data type of the `input()` function without casting is `string`
* You will have to print the `int` result as a separate `print()` statement because you cannot combine `str` and `int`
* DIVIDING PROGRAM: You will need to cast the inputs as a type `float`
   * To cast as a `float`
     ```
     float(10)
     ```
   * `10` then becomes `10.0`
   * but you won't know that until you `print` it

### Instructions

1. Create a program that adds two numbers
2. Create a program that subtracts the second input number from the first input number
3. Create a program that will divide the first input number with the second
