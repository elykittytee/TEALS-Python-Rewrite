# 2.04 Lists


## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **list, item, index, integer**.
* Be able to access items from a list using the index.
* Create lists of different types.
* Use the length function.

## Activity

### Type in the following:

```python
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    print(len(a_list))
```

### Answer the following discussion questions as a comment:

1. What type do you think a_list is? (Hint: look at the variable name.)
2. What does `len` do?
3. Brainstorm how you would print the first element from `a_list`.

### In the console, type the following:

```python
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    print(a_list[0])
    print(a_list[1])
    print(a_list[2])
    print(a_list[3])
    print(a_list[4])
    print(a_list[5])
    print(a_list[6])
```
#### Record your prediction as a comment

### Continue in your notes.

Describe what happened when the program was run.  Were there any differences from your predictions?

## Practice

### Predictions

For each example below, predict what will be printed. Run the program and write down the output in your notebook.

#### Example 1

```python
    a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    print(a[0])
    print(a[3])
```

#### Example 2

```python
    a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    print(a[len(a) - 3])
```

#### Example 3

```python
    a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    print(a[len(a) - 6])
```

#### Example 4

```python
    a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    a[3] = 'haha'
    print(a)
```
