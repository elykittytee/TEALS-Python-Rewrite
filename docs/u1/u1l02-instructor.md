Instructor's notes

## Activity - Part 1

Give students time to work on section 1.

#### Discussion section 1

* What does the // do? How is that different from /? And how are those different from %?
* What's the difference between 3.0 and 3?
* Go over the following two terms:
  1. **Floats**: a data type, number with a decimal point.
  2. **Integers**: a data type, number without a decimal point.
* Now, give students time to work on section 2.

#### Discussion section 2

* What happened when you typed in a?
* What do you think that error message mean?
* Go over **String**: a data type, characters surrounded in single or double quotes.

* What happens when you multiply strings?

## Activity - Part 2

* Define **expression**: a combination of values and operators (and variables)
* Ask students to give an example of an expression.
* Make sure students write down their predictions before going to the interpreter/IDE to check the actual output.

### Debrief

* Discuss any surprising/unexpected results.
* Remind students of adding strings together using `+`.
* Talk about how single and double quotes are interchangeable.
* Multiplying strings.
* Order of Operations is the same as what students have learned in math class.
* Discuss why it might be helpful to have an interactive console.
