# Lesson 1.01: Set Up - Student Directions

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **IDE**, **Python**.
* Identify the key concepts that will be covered in the course.
* Save and turn in a file.

### Python/IDE Intro

#### Introduce Python

* **Python** is a text-based programming language, uses tabbing/indentation to control execution, and is known for its readability.
* ___Look___ at this example of a Python program. Make 3 observations about the program.

```python
print("hello world")

def my_function(name):
    print("hello world, " + name)

my_function("Susan")
```

* Discuss your observations with a classmate
* Record your observations as a comment in `main.py`

#### Comments

```python
#This is a comment.
#The IDE or console will -not- run this as part of the program

print('This is not a comment. This will show and be run as Python code.')
```

#### IDE - Integrated Development Environment

* An **IDE** is an application that allows you to create, edit, save, and run programs.
* Note that with Python, we can't use drag and drop blocks anymore - it is a language that must be typed into an IDE.
* Identify the different parts of the Replit IDE


## Activity 

* Copy the program code from Python/IDE Intro above into the IDE (the left side)
* Run the program (press *Run* at the top)
* What do you think happened?
* Record your answer as a comment
