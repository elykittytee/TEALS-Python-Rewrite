# 1.03 Script Mode & Variables

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...
- Define and identify: script, print, run, output, variable.
- Write a simple script and run it in the IDE.
- Print values out to the console (both composed values and from variables).
- Compare script mode vs interactive mode.
- Know how to store a value into a variable.

## Activity In-Class
Type the following expressions in the `console`

```
2*3*5

"abc"

'abc' + 'bde'
```
What's the result?

Type the statement below into the `editor` portion of the IDE. (Hint: `main.py`)

```
print(2*3*5)
```
What is the result? What does `print()` do? Repeat this process for 3 different (new) values.

## Independent Activity

### Part 1

- Practice typing out some statements in the `editor` part of the IDE
- Press `Run` at the top to compile
```
print("1")
print(1)
print(1+2)
print("this" + " " + "is" + " " + a" + " " + "sentence" + ".")
```
- Make mental (or real!) notes of the result
### Part 2

- Type and run the following:
```
animal = 'dogs'
print(animal+' are really cool.')
```
- What happens?
- How would you make the program print out `cats are really cool` instead?
- *Answer as a comment*

- Type and run the following:
```
print(dogs + " are cool.")
```
- What output does this produce?
- Why do you think this happens?
- *Answer as a comment*
