## Tic-Tac-Toe
Create this game using lists and indexes, according to the following rules:

1. The user will pick a location on the board according to this diagram printed by the program:

```
     1 | 2 | 3  
    -----------
     4 | 5 | 6  
    -----------
     7 | 8 | 9
```

2. Depending on the position that the user inputs, update the corresponding list element to be an "X".
